 * This script was used on earlier versions to create cms blocks for

 *
 * To maximize compatibility with other modules like Market Ready Germany
 * of GermanSetup/ MageSetup, we do not create this anymore.
 *
 * If one of the mentioned modules is installed, there are normally already
 * cms blocks for that purpose. Otherwise, the user has to create blocks manually.
 * In either case he/she has to define them in the configuration.
